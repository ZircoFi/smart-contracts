# ZircoFi contracts

Smart contracts for ZircoFi: a non-custodial swap venue for tokenized real-world assets on Robinhood Chain. Anchor vaults quote both sides of every market around the guarded Chainlink mid, block-size flow settles through signed RFQ maker quotes, and one router composes the two behind a single entry point, settled in USDG.

Built with Foundry for Robinhood Chain (chain ID 4663), an Arbitrum Nitro chain.

## Layout

```
src/
  SwapRouter.sol              sole trader entry point: eligibility, vault-versus-RFQ selection, two-leg composition
  AnchorVault.sol             one per market: oracle-anchored quoting, inventory skew, LP shares, in-kind withdrawal
  VaultFactory.sol            deploys vaults and is the registry the router resolves them from
  RfqSettlement.sol           EIP-712 maker quotes, nonce cancellation, atomic band-checked settlement
  OracleRouter.sol            Chainlink feeds and streams with session, staleness, move-cap and sequencer guards
  EligibilityRegistry.sol     role checks through a swappable policy adapter
  adapters/NativeAttestationAdapter.sol   self-contained attestation store with EAS semantics
  ParamController.sol         every tunable parameter behind a timelock; guardian can only pause swaps
  FeeCollector.sol            receives the itemised swap fees, RFQ fees and the protocol spread share
  libraries/                  Types (quotes, breakdowns, roles and constants)
  interfaces/                 protocol and external (Chainlink, ERC-8056) interfaces
  mocks/                      local-development stand-ins: USDG, Stock Token, aggregator, stream adapter
script/Deploy.s.sol           full deployment and configuration; opens the launch market
script/Seed.s.sol             seeds a fresh testnet deployment with liquidity and a first pair of fills
script/Activity.s.sol         adds a round of multi-wallet activity (deposits, a withdrawal, a batch of swaps)
test/                         Foundry suite: vault accounting, swap pricing, regimes and halts, RFQ, governance
deployments/                  addresses written by the deploy script, one JSON file per chain ID
```
